### MANG_stockanalysis

A short analysis of AMZN and META, show their stocks standard deviations. Standard deviation helps determine market volatility or the spread of asset prices from their average price. When prices move wildly, standard deviation is high, meaning an investment will be risky. Low standard deviation means prices are calm, so investments come with low risk.

In this analysis, I am calculating the standard deviations for two stocks, Amazon and META, from their given stock prices over the course of several weeks. To find their standard deviations, I created a function (nonfunctional_stdev) rather than use the in-built functions in Python for practice.
